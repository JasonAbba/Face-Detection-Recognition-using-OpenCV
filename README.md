# Face-Detection-Recognition-using-OpenCV
The script uses webcam feed to detect and recognize faces and then tag them.

## Introduction
This script was is a part of a bigger project where I was assigned to do the login part of the software. So instead of using the traditional methods of usernames and passwords, I gave the user option to login into the application using face dectection and recognition. The script would grant access to the users whose face would match of those in the database.
